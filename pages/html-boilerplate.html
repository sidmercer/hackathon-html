    <h2 id="boilerplate">HTML Boilerplate Code</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: The First Principle (The Fundamental Truth)</h3>
    <p>
        The fundamental truth is that a web browser is a program that needs <strong>specific, predictable instructions</strong> 
        to do its job. It cannot guess your intentions. You can't just give it a file with a <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag and 
        expect it to know what kind of document it is, what language it's in, or how to render it properly.
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h3>Step 2: The Core Problem</h3>
    <p>We need a way to give the browser essential "setup information" before it starts rendering our visible content (like paragraphs and images). This setup information needs to answer critical questions:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>"What version of HTML am I reading?"</strong> (So I know which rules to follow).</li>
        <li><strong>"What character encoding should I use?"</strong> (So characters like ©, ’, or ₹ are displayed correctly and not as gibberish like â€™).</li>
        <li><strong>"What should the title of the browser tab be?"</strong></li>
        <li><strong>"How should this page behave on a mobile device vs. a desktop?"</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Just writing <p>Hello</p> doesn't answer any of these questions.</p>

    <hr>
    <h3>Step 3: The Logical Solution - The HTML Boilerplate</h3>
    <p>The solution is to use a standard "boilerplate" template that includes all the necessary setup information. This boilerplate acts as a reliable foundation for every HTML document you create.</p>
 
    <h3>The Anatomy of the HTML Boilerplate</h3>
    <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

    <h2 id="website-without-boilerplate">But Website Work Even Without Boilerplate</h2>
    <h3>Browsers are Built to Be <strong>Extremely Forgiving</strong>.</h3>
    <p>Think about the early days of the web...</p>

    <h3>The Core Problem: How to Handle "Bad" HTML?</h3>
    <p>A browser's job is to display <em>something</em>, no matter what you give it...</p>

    <h3>So, Why Use a Boilerplate if the Browser Fixes Everything?</h3>
    <p>You're right that for a simple "Hello World" page, it looks the same...</p>

    <hr>
     <h2 id="multipage">Multipage Website</h2>
    <p>
        The fundamental truth is that complex information is almost never presented on a single, infinitely long page. 
        We naturally break information into distinct, self-contained topics. A book has chapters, a store has departments, 
        and a company has different aspects (About, Services, Contact).
    </p>
    <p>A multi-page website is the digital equivalent of this.</p>

    <h3 id="problem">The Core Problem</h3>
    <p>
        We need a way to create these distinct topic pages and, most importantly, a way for a user to 
        <strong>navigate between them seamlessly</strong>. How do we connect <code>home.html</code> to 
        <code>about.html</code> and <code>contact.html</code> so that they feel like a single, cohesive 
        "website" rather than three disconnected files?
    </p>

    <h3 id="solution">The Logical Solution: A Shared Structure and a Navigation System</h3>
    <p>The solution involves two key components:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>A Consistent Structure:</strong> All pages on the site should share a common look and feel. 
            They should have the same header (with the logo and navigation) and the same footer. 
            This reassures the user that they are still on the same website.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>A Linking System:</strong> We need to use the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> (anchor) tag to create 
            a navigation menu that appears on <em>every single page</em>, providing reliable doorways to all 
            other pages.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="div">The &lt;div&gt; (The Generic Box)</h2>
    <h3>First Principle (The Fundamental Truth)</h3>
    <p>We need a way to group different elements together (h1 , p ,img etc..) into a single, conceptual unit.</p>

    <h3>The Core Problem</h3>
    <p>Imagine you have a "user profile card" on a webpage. It consists of an image, a heading for the user's name, and a paragraph for their bio.</p>
<p>HTML code:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;img src="avatar.png"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Rohit negi&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loves to code | llorem &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
this will display as:
    <div>
        <img src="../images/rohit-negi.png" height="200px" alt="rohit negi">
        <h2>Rohit negi</h2>
        <p>Loves to code | Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Saepe sint veniam tenetur eum autem aliquid magnam laboriosam libero quas numquam neque quos, laborum recusandae dolore, modi illo, voluptates amet. Corporis!</p>
    </div>
<p>These are three separate elements. What if you want to put a border around all three of them as a single block? Or give them all a shared background color? Or move them all to the right side of the page as one unit? You have no way to target them as a group.</p>
<h3>The Logical Solution: The Generic Container</h3> 
<p>The most basic solution is to invent a generic, meaningless container. Its only job is to be a box that you can put other things into. It shouldn't have any inherent meaning or style; it's just a grouping mechanism.</p>   
<p>This is the &lt;div &gt; (short for "division").
<br>
By wrapping our elements in a &lt;div&gt;, we create a single "box" that we can now control.</p>
<p>Html code: </p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;img src="avatar.png"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Arjun Kumar&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loves to code and teach HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
this will display as:
    <div>
        <img src="../images/rohit-negi.png" height="200px" alt="rohit negi">
        <h2>Rohit Negi</h2>
        <p>Loves to code | Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Saepe sint veniam tenetur eum autem aliquid magnam laboriosam libero quas numquam neque quos, laborum recusandae dolore, modi illo, voluptates amet. Corporis!</p>
    </div>
    <p>Now, using CSS, we can say "put a border on that <div>" and it will wrap around the entire group.</p>

    <h2 id="class-id">Class and id (The Labels for the Box)</h2>
    <h3>First Principle</h3>
    <p>Once we have boxes (&lt;div&gt;s), we need a way to identify and find them.</p>
<h3>The Core Problem</h3>
    <p>
        Your webpage might have ten different profile cards, a sidebar, a main content area, and a photo gallery—all made of 
        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s. How do you tell the browser (specifically, your CSS or JavaScript) which box you want to style? 
        How do you say, "Make <em>all</em> the profile cards have a gray background, but make the <em>one</em> featured profile card 
        have a gold border?" You need a targeting system.
    </p>

    <h3>The Logical Solution: Two Types of Labels</h3>
    <p>
        The logical solution is to invent two types of labels (which we call <strong>attributes</strong>) that you can add to any HTML tag.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>A Unique Identifier:</strong> We need a label for one, and only one, specific element on the entire page. 
            It must be unique. This is perfect for major, one-of-a-kind layout sections like the main navigation bar or a search form. 
            This is the <strong>id</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>A Reusable Classifier:</strong> We also need a label that we can apply to <em>multiple</em> elements to group them into a category. 
            This is for things that have a similar style or function, like all the profile cards, all the error messages, or all the "buy now" buttons. 
            This is the <strong>class</strong>.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>An <strong>id</strong> is like a person's unique <strong>Social Security Number or Aadhaar Number</strong>. Only one person can have it.</li>
        <li>A <strong>class</strong> is like a person's <strong>Job Title</strong> (e.g., "Engineer"). Many people in a company can have the class "Engineer".</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code>&lt;div id="main-header"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="featured-profile" class="profile-card"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="profile-card"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="profile-card"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now in CSS, you can target them:
<ol></ol>
    <li>#main-header { ... } (Targets the one unique element with that ID)</li>
    <li>.profile-card { ... } (Targets ALL THREE elements with that class)</li>
    <li>#featured-profile { ... } (Targets only the one special card to give it a gold border)</li>
</ol>
</p>

    <h2 id="span">The &lt;span&gt; (The Inline Highlighter)</h2>
     <h3>First Principle</h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes we need to label and style a piece of content <em>within</em> a line of text, without creating a new block.
    </p>

    <h3>The Core Problem</h3>
    <p>What if you want to make just a <em>single word</em> inside a paragraph red?</p>

    <p>This is very important information.</p>

    <p>
        You need to select the word "important". If you wrap it in a 
        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, it will create a line break, ruining the sentence:
    </p>

    <p>This is very <code>&lt;div&gt;important&lt;/div&gt;</code> information.</p>
    <p> Renders incorrectly.</p>

 
    <h3>The Logical Solution: The Generic Inline Container</h3>
    <p>
        We need a container that works just like a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, but is <strong>inline</strong>, 
        meaning it does <em>not</em> create a line break. It just wraps a small piece of content within 
        the natural flow of the text.
    </p>
    <p>html code :</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;This is very &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;important&lt;/span&gt; information.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

    <p>
        This is the <strong>&lt;span&gt;</strong>. Now you can use CSS to target the 
        <code>.highlight</code> class and make that one word red, without affecting the layout of the paragraph.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> A <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is like using a <strong>highlighter pen</strong>. 
    You can mark a few words in a book without having to rip out the page and put it in a separate box.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>&lt;header&gt;</strong>: This is the box for the introductory content at the top of your page or a section. It typically contains your logo, site navigation (<code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>), and main heading.</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;footer&gt;</strong>: The box for the closing content at the bottom. It usually contains copyright info, contact details, and secondary links.</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;main&gt;</strong>: This is the most important one. It defines the <strong>main, unique content</strong> of that specific page. It should not contain things that are repeated on every page (like the header or footer). There should only be <strong>one</strong> <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag per page.</li>
    </ul>
